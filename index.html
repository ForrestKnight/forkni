 hello world, this is my initial commit to centralizing my entire online life.<br/>
 all so that i can make it decentralized (self-hosted, technically. or if not hosted, just copies of some of the things).
<br/><br/>
need to self-host <a href="https://forrestpknight.com">a couple</a><a href="https://fkcodes.com"> of websites</a> and i need to change them. they suck.
<br/><br/>
check out <a href="https://youtube.com/fknight">my youtube channel</a> (actually already have copies of final videos backed up).
<br/><br/>
need to backup <a href="https://github.com/forrestknight">my github repos</a> after so many accounts getting banned recently.
<br/><br/>
that's basically it. everything else like my x and linkedin and instagram content can fall off a cliff for all i care. <br/>
<a href="https://x.com/forrestpknight">x</a> is fun though.
<br/><br/>
